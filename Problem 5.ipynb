Description and explanation   <a id='5.1.3'></a>\n","\n","\n","Let's now describe the result qualitatively, provide an explanation for what we observe and compare the plots for the different architectures.\n","\n","First, we will discuss the similarities between the three architectures. We note that for the 3 architectures, the loss seems to decreases as we advance in the sequence. In fact for the RNN and the GRU, the high loss at the beginning can be explained by the fact that the word in the sequence is varies from a sequence to another and it can also be explained by the fact that it is the first word, so we didn't have previous words to it to diminush the uncertainty about it. However, for the following words, we notice generally that whenever the loss increases, it decreases again. This means that the probability of the correct word $t$ given a previous word that is very uncertain is higher, thus the loss is lower. This discussion doesn't apply to the transformer since it is not grounded around the recurrence mechanism but around the attention mechanism. We can then explain it's loss plot by the fact that we mask future words. Thus, the more we advance in the sentence, the more linked we are to the context.\n","\n","The behaviour of the GRU is better overall and more stable from the loss of a word to another. This is because the GRU can track long-term dependencies better, thus the uncertainly over a given word $t$ is lower because the model remembers many previous words that help it find the right word at position $t$. The transformer and the RNN display the same overall behaviour with different intensity and around different mean loss, even though they aren't based on the same principle.

We said in the previous question that a direct consequence to this is that the GRU can track long-term dependencies better than the RNN. So let's try to explain this.

able to track long-term dependencies compared to RNN and able to avoid the problem of vanishing gradient, RNN might give more meaningfull sentences starting with the same random word. For example, the sentence starting \" frequent \" is considered as 3 best sequences for the RNN and 3 worst sequences for the GRU. \n","  We also notice that RNN puts words that have close meaning next to each other, but words who are far don't share the same meaning (ref. sentence that starts with \"drawings\"). This can be explained by the vanishing gradient problem again. Overall, GRU seems to outperform RNN for long sequences, which is coherent with previous analysis.\n","  \n","  P.S: we noticed later that as we fixed the seed, thus all the 4 packages of the sequences started with the same 10 words.
